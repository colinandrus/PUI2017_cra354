***Assignment 1:Run using python3***

I worked alone on my Authorea article from the updated HW3 citinike project using Sarah Schoengold's (sebscho) reccomendations.

The pdf formatted strangely and doesn't include the linked code.
Here is a link to the article on Authorea:

***Assignment 2: Run using python2. Will not work with python3!***

I used the code we had wrote together in class for some problems and edited it to show station names rather than the data for making a map with CARTO.

Run using python2. Will not work with python3!
