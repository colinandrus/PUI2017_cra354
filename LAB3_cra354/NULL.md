### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample. Just diet or just exercise.

H0:
Do diets lose less or equal fat than exercise. If the test and control distributions are not significantly different or the diet is significantly worse at losing weight.
Pt <= Pc

Ha:
The distributions of test is significantl higher than conrol
Pt > Pc

**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

H0:
When only comparing children of the same age the distributions of children of smokers IQs less than or greater than those of non-smokers.
Pc > Pt, Pc < Pt

Ha:
When only comparing children of the same age  the distributions of children of smokers IQs equal to  those of non-smokers.
Pc = Pt

**Contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.

H0:
The intersection of census of > 10% of the population having diabetes is equal or less than random chance

Ha:
The intersection of census of > 10% of the population having diabetes is higher than random chance
